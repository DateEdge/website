      We've intentionally kept <b>Date Edge</b> very simple.
      You can only a few things with other people on this site.
      We believe that a dating site should stay out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find people, look at the high-level labels, then message them.
      Talk to other humans, find out if you're a good match, then go on a date.
