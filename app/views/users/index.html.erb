      We've intentionally kept <b>Date Edge</b> very simple.
      You can only a few things with other people on this site.
      We believe that a dating site should stay out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Find people, look at the high-level labels, then message them.
      Talk to other humans, find out if you're a good match, then go on a date.
    </p>

      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.
