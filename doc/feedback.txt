Ya, I'm fairly tech-y too so I might notice some stuff in the UI.  When I tried to do it from my iPhone I got an error that wouldn't let me proceed at all.  When trying to log in with Facebook it didn't load my profile photo and said it did.  When I uploaded a photo there was no confirmation screen and I had to click through a few times before it uploaded a photo.  When I went to make my avatar I can't make a selection and since my photo has 2 people in it, I would need to be able to adjust which part of the photo becomes the avatar.  Also, maybe there should be a note about FB not posting on your behalf.  Lots of people don't like people knowing they are on a dating site.  :/

Also, I don't fit into any of those categories.

I wish there was a "1-3 drinks/month" or something like that.  Or something that suggests you don't give a shit about drinking/getting wasted.  But maybe I am in the minority on that.  I just feel like straight edge curious makes me sound like an idiot that doesn't know about the sXe lifestyle.  I could also go for diets "strict vegan" category.  Don't worry about my suggestions though.  It is your site.  

My bio is imported from FB but gets cut off too.
